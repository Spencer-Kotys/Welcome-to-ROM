## Stakeholders

1. Cadets, the people who live in Chase Hall. The Cadets will play the game to
relive the experience that is ROM. 

2. Developers, those who built the game. The Developers will improve their software
engineering skills and learn valuable concepts of game design. The developers will
also create graphics and audio for the game.

3. Professors, funding organization. The Professors are hosting this assignment. 
They set requirements for the structure of the project.

## Description

ROM is a two dimensional simulation game, and will have a top down game design
where the camera follows the player. The player will have a morale meter which
is effected by game play, and if it reaches zero, the game ends in a loss. The
player can also lose by getting sent to Munro Hall, which would occur if the
player gets COVID-19 or gets contact traced by one of the characters the player
interacts with. When the player attends social events and interacts with other
characters to improve their morale meter, there is an increased random chance
that they can be sent down to Munro Hall or test positive for Covid. The player's 
goal is to balance maintaining the morale meter with limiting the chances of 
getting COVID-19. the player makes it to the end of day 14, then they win!

# Architecture

## Main Scene

The main scene is specific area in the game that the character is in. This is what
the player will mostly see.

## Supporting Scenes

Supporting scenes are things like the HUD or the character sprit itself. These
are superimposed on the main scene and add to the main scene functionality.

## Godot

Godot is an open source game engine that provides much of the low level functionality
required for a game to run such as interacting with rendering software.

## Description

ROM is a two dimensional simulation game, and will have a top down game design
where the camera follows the player. The player will have a morale meter which
is effected by game play, and if it reaches zero, the game ends in a loss. The
player can also lose by getting sent to Munro Hall, which would occur if the
player gets COVID-19 or gets contact traced by one of the characters the player
interacts with. When the player attends social events and interacts with other
characters to improve their morale meter, there is an increased random chance
that they can be sent down to Munro Hall. The player's goal is to balance
maintaining the morale meter with limiting the chances of getting COVID-19. If
the player makes it to the end of day 14, then they win!
